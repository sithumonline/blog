Golang is a simple, highly readable, c like language only with 25 keywords.

    break        default      func         interface    select  
    case         defer        go           map          struct  
    chan         else         goto         package      switch  
    const        fallthrough  if           range        type    
    continue     for          import       return       var     

You can do **whatever** you want with that 25 keywords. Golang is very easy to learn and master.
